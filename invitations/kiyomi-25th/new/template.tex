\section*{raison d'Ãªtre}

An excuse to summon the illest mfs in town. But apart from that K. Sano has never had a Birthday Party!

Beatrice Portinari died at 25 and so did \href{https://abaj.ai/blog/mia/}{Mia}. Alas, we will be celebrating life; \href{https://frizzande.io/articles/thirty_three/}{another lap around the sun}, on Sunday the 5\textsuperscript{th}. The following day is a public holiday\footnote{Labour Day}, so you all may exhale away the ethanol in leisure \emoji{salt}.

A note on the \emph{debauchery}: there will be drink and smoke, choose your own adventure/s --- there will be no snakes -- we have cats. Dress fly, but not too fly --- we have cats.

Pending the weather, which one month out looks bleak; we will (optimistically) have table tennis going, music, a fire, the oven and a cake at Midnight. Crashes are first come first served. \mbox{Plus 1's welcome.}

Regarding presents, please don't feel obligated. Nonetheless, Kiyomi is a creative soul; she is musical and artistic. She asked for a guitar strap so you can get one of those. We also need a spare Nintendo Switch remote if someone is balling. I'll get her some stamps that she wants.

Booze is always a shout and so is your damn companionship.

I will be shopping at Costco for savoury stuff, and then the oven will cook the marinated meats. We have finite fridge space, so be wary of bringing too much food.

We look forward to catching up with y'all. 

Stay Savvy,
-AJ
