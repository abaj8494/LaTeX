# plagiarism only hurts you.

academic integrity warnings aside, i have completed many assignments in my life.

some, of higher quality than others, but i have certainly come to a consensus on a small bag of tricks / imports and redefs.

as such, i have version controlled a few assignments, the ones that i tend to reference when creating _new_ assignments.

# obfuscation

- i have tried to hide this code in plain-sight. 
- there are no compiled documents here
- the non-existence of course codes should cause your reg-ex attempts to fail.

# treasures

nonetheless, i am proud of the treasures here.
